# frida-learning

This repo is to document my learning with the frida tool and android vulnerability research.
To start i'll be working through some challenges from http://ctf.hpandro.raviramesh.info which is a really cool website that
is hosting an android vulnerability research CTF with their own android app presenting the attack surface.
